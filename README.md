Assignment: CSS Hell
====================

You will skin 3 project gutenberg stories with custom CSS.

### Part 1:
The html files had to be modified such that they used the styles.css stylesheet.
The Christmas Carol's html page had images already, but not all images had captions. Captions that were missing were taken 
from the images' alt tags and manually added as captions. 

Added fonts: Quintessential-Regular, Vinque (both are cleared for use).

---

You will skin 2 versions of a possible professional homepage for your
self with 2 versions of CSS.
