        <a id="whoiam"><h2>Who I Am</h2></a>
            <p>
                I am a student at the University of Alberta in my final year getting a 
                Bachelor's Degree Specialization in Computing Science and Minor in Business.
            </p>
            <p>
                I enjoy rock climbing, playing music, and hanging out on patios on summer days. 
            </p>

        <a id="professionalhistory"><h2>Professional History</h2></a>
            <p>
                For the past two years, I have worked in the R&D Engineering and Testing
                Department of Haemonetics, a medical device and supplies company, as a 
                software developer. I worked primarily with Java Spring, Hibernate, Javascript,
                PL/SQL, HTML, and CSS to develop medical device software. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Before that, I worked for Deco Windshield repair and helped debug, optimize, manage, and contribute
                to their online records of sales and customer/employee information. This included using tools such as 
                Zapier, Klipfolio (data presentation tool with a syntax similar to SQL), Excel, and Slack integrations.
                I helped find ways to visualize and track data such that employee productivity could improve and business trends
                could be recognized.
            </p>
        
        <a id="havetooffer"><h2>What Do I have to Offer A Potential Employer?</h2></a>

        <p>
            Aside from my education and work experience, I believe the most important qualities I have to
            offer a potential employer are that I'm a fast learner, I work hard, and I'm passionate about 
            computer science and tech. Because of these three traits, I'm able to tackle problems very quickly
            as I am eager to learn and can spend as much time as is required to do what needs to be done. I'm 
            energized when I do this because I enjoy the subject matter so much.
